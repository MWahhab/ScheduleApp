</p>

**Title** and **Description** fields are required.

A **non repeating** task can be created by choosing a **date due** for the task, weekday selection is not necessary in this case.
Creation of tasks in the past is not allowed, as time travel technology is not yet accessible to the general public in 2022 /s.

**Editing a repeating task** and all of its instances is incredibly simple in Task Scheduler.

Simply clicking any of the tasks on any which day will bring up the edit window. Changing anything in one repeating tasks edit window will change all instances of itself without any hassle.

The edit form will be the same as the creation form, therefor no further images will be shared.

Converting non-repeating tasks to repeating tasks and vice versa is possible and easy.

### The Search feature

When hovering the **magnifying glass icon**, a search input field will be revealed

Searching for a task and clicking it after it autocompletes will let the user jump to the week where the task took place.

The search feature is only meant for tasks with a set date. Repeating tasks will be occuring every week and will found by navigating with the date-picker widget.

### Date-picker widget

**The date-picker widget** allows users to select a specific date. The week during the clicked date will be rendered as the weekly calendar view.

I am forever grateful for everyone working hard for developers to be able to freely use amazing tools such as Laravel. It is the reason why I'm motivated to contribute to the open source community.
